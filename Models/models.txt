Model used :
DBSCAN Algorithm 
Density based clustering

How it works?

Based on a set of points , DBSCAN groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement and a minimum number of points. It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions.

In my data set it marks the Data points with -1 to identify those are outliers
