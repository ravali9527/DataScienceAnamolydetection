Data set used :
Real Traffic Data set 

Data used : speed data (Speed_6005.csv)

Over view of Dataset: This dataset set contains details about the occupancy based on traffic and speed 

Data given :
The given data set contains the speed at which a vehicle is travelling at a particular time.

Feature engineering:

1)number of vehicles travelling on each day at a particular sped
2)Extracted data about how many vehicles are travelling at a speed grater than 90 at a particular time

Algorithm Used :

1)Used DBSCAN Algorithm to detect the outliers in given data set 
2)DBSCAn algorithm uses clustering approach to find the anomalies in the given data set
3)The data points which are of maximum distance from any cluster are represented by -1 which states those are anomalies
4)Used box plots to determine which are outliers 
5)
From the plot we can state the 17 outliers in given data set .
